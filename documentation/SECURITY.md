1. **Email**: Send details to [security@yourproject.com](mailto:security@yourproject.com)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/yourusername/metadata-builder/security/advisories) feature

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish?
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Version, OS, database type, configuration details
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow responsible disclosure practices
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will coordinate the timing of public disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using Metadata Builder:

1. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information (API keys, passwords) in environment variables, not in configuration files
2. **Network Security**: Use secure connections (SSL/TLS) for database connections
3. **Access Control**: Limit database user permissions to only what's necessary
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep Metadata Builder and its dependencies up to date
5. **Configuration Review**: Regularly review your configuration for security issues

### For Developers

When contributing to Metadata Builder:

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries and avoid string concatenation
3. **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets to version control
4. **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies and monitor for vulnerabilities
5. **Code Review**: All code changes must go through security-focused code review

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Parameterized Queries**: SQL injection protection through parameterized queries
- **Connection Security**: Support for SSL/TLS database connections
- **Environment Variables**: Secure handling of sensitive configuration
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Code Analysis**: Static code analysis for security issues

### Planned Security Enhancements

- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit logging for all operations
- **Role-Based Access**: Fine-grained access control for different operations
- **Encryption**: At-rest encryption for sensitive metadata
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks

## Common Security Considerations

### Database Connections

- Use read-only database users when possible
- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
- Use connection pooling with appropriate limits
- Implement connection timeouts

### API Keys and Secrets

- Store API keys in environment variables
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use least-privilege access for API keys
- Monitor API key usage

### Data Privacy

- Be aware of sensitive data in your databases
- Consider data masking for sensitive fields
- Implement appropriate data retention policies
- Comply with relevant privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
